# Using Jekyll with Pages

This site uses Jekyll, a static website builder.  It is tightly integrated with Github Pages.

See 
https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll
for more on using Jekyll with Github Pages.  Notably:

Execute
	
    bundle exec jekyll serve [--detach]

in the root directory to build and serve the page.  Use

    bundle exec build --watch &

to build only.  Use

    bundle update

in the root directory to update jekyll dependencies.

# Preparing Images

## Using ImageMagick to convert an image to another format:

    convert file.tif file.jpg

## Using ImageMagick to resize a file (for e.g. creating thumbnails):

    convert -resize x100 file.jpg file_thumb.jpg

## Examples

    (Replace all spaces with dashes)
    rename "s/ /-/" *
   
    (Convert all tifs to jpgs)
    for fn in `ls -1 *tif`; do pref=`echo $fn | awk 'BEGIN {FS="."};{print $1}'`; convert $pref.tif $pref.jpg; done

    (Create thumbnails from regular-sized jpgs)
    for fn in `ls -1 *jpg`; do pref=`echo $fn | awk 'BEGIN {FS="."};{print $1}'`; convert -resize x100 ${pref}.jpg ${pref}_thumb.jpg; done

    (Rename all files to 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.)
    i=1; for f in `ls -1`; do mv $f $i.jpg; ((i++)); done

# Posting a new Gallery page

Assuming new gallery with date YYYY-MM-DD and title this-title and number of photos = NUM_PHOTOS:

1. Grab post template:
    cp resources/post-templates/gallery.md _posts/gallery/YYYY-MM-DD-this-title.md

2. Replace title, TOTAL_PICS_NO, and FOLDER_NAME values within that new page.

3. Create folder images/YYYY-MM-DD-this-title; convert, rename, and create thumbnails (see above) so that you have filenames 1.jpg, 1_thumb.jpg, 2.jpg, 2_thumb.jpg, etc. in that folder.

# Backlog

This is a list of ideas for improvement to the website and associated tools.

* add wait list for boat slips - get list from Don Price; application for the wait list; application for beach key ('pier' tab for those three?)
* check analytics; add access to the carrolltonmanorweb@gmail.com email, and tell Lisa what I find
* for events, click-to-add to google calendar?
* RSS?
* username/pw login access to security cameras, or read-only access?
* set up private login section for kid babysitting signups?, etc.
* calendar of events?
* put newsletter stories on the web?
* google map for quick view of our community
