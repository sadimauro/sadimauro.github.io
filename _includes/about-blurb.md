Founded in 1931 as a vacation community, Severna Park's Carrollton Manor remains beautiful and vibrant.  Situated between Annapolis and Baltimore, 
Carrollton Manor features community beaches and piers along with proximity to shopping and great schools.  The Community is maintained by our 
active residents, including participants in the <a href="/cmia">Carrollton Manor Improvement Association</a>.
