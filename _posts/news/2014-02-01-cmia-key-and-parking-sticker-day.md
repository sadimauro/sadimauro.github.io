CMIA Key and Parking Sticker Day is **Saturday, March 8th, 9:00am - 12:00pm**, at the Severna Park Baptist Church Fellowship Hall, 506 Benfield Road.

All CMIA gate keys and parking stickers will expire this year!
New keys and parking stickers will be good for 2 years. All
community property locks will be changed on May 1, 2014. To
avoid being locked out of Hillbottom Beach, the boat ramp &
pier, as well as CrabAway Pier, please make every effort to
stop by.

This year the application is included in this newsletter (see facing page) to expedite the process. Please bring
all necessary paperwork and documentation to Key Day.

Please try to get your keys now - after key day, keys will be available only at CMIA community meetings or
by appointment only. Appointments can arranged by calling Lillian Serio at 410-647-5450, ONLY on weekday
evenings between 6:00pm- 9:00pm. Please do not call at other times.
You will need to bring your driver’s license or a form of ID as proof of Carrollton Manor residency. You will
also need to bring your car registration showing your tag number for purchase of stickers.

#### Canoe Rack Lottery

Applications for the canoe rack lottery will be available at the upcoming March 4th Community
Meeting and on Key Day at the Severna Park Baptist
Church Fellowship Hall. Canoes and watercraft without an assigned slip or rack will be considered
“abandoned” and will be removed from any community properties. Once assigned a rack, all canoes
must be secured when not in use.
