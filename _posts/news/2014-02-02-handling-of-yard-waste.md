With that
 said, yard waste and tree trimmings
should be composted or placed at the
curb for pick up, not dumped on
CMIA Community Property. You
may think it is only leaves, but it
builds up into debris and becomes
trash.

We have been working hard to beautify our neighborhood. Anything
dumped on East Drive, Severn Rd,
Park Rd, and the woods at Hillbottom can become our responsibility to
cleanup.
The community has had to deal with,
and sometimes pay for, the removal
of leaves, yard trash, and tree
branches on community property or
in the woods.
