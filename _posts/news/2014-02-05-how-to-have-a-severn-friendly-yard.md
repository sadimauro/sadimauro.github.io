### Rain Barrels
Install a rain barrel under the gutter of your home to har-
vest rain water from your home’s roof. This prevents
stormwater, the number one pollutant, from entering the
Severn River. Why is this important? There is an amaz-
ing amount of pollutant living on our roofs and during a
rain storm, these pollutants are mixed with rain water and
washed down into ditches and directly into the Severn
River.

Did you also know that the lawn and garden uses 40% of
household water during the growing season? A rain barrel
will help reduce this usage! The water collected can be
used for watering flower beds and gardens. If every CMIA
household had two 50 gallon rain barrels each (CMIA has
approximately 550 homes), 55,000 gallons of stormwater
water pollutants would be prevented from entering the
river.

The benefits of a rain barrel are:
* Conserving Water
* Prevention of contaminated stormwater from entering the Severn River
* Helps prevent erosion
* Helps prevent flooding
* Very pretty landscape feature
* Provides water for your plants and gardens.

To install a rain barrel, all you typically need is a 55 gallon
drum rain barrel, a vinyl hose, PVC couplings, and a
screen to keep our debris
and insects (very important to keep our mosquito
population down).
Rain Barrels can be purchased at major retailers
like Ace Hardware, Sam’s
Club, Home Depot, Arlington Echo, Plow &
Hearth, Amazon.com,
and Rainbarrel-source.com.

### Rain Gardens
Rain Gardens are another very important way to help improve the water quality of the Severn River and Chesa-
peake Bay. Rain gardens beautiful functioning gardens
that allows rain water runoff from impervious surfaces
such as roofs, driveways, and parking lots to be absorbed.
Rain gardens prevent stormwater from entering our waterways. Native Maryland plants are recommended for rain
gardens because they do not require fertilizer and are already adapted to our climate and soil conditions. Additionally, native plants attract local wildlife.
In order to install a rain garden, the following checklist
should be completed:

1. Check to see if a grading permit is needed for your
property (greater than 5000 sq ft)
2. Test the Ph of your soil
3. Determine what type of soil amendments are needed, for example Leafgro
4. Dig and plant your garden

A rain garden should not take more than one to two days
to install. More information can be found at the link above.
