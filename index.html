		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This will be one-player Battleship: you are the guessers and we control the ships.  So your objective is to sink all of our ships in the fewest moves possible.</p>
		<p>We've hidden three ships on our board: one Battleship (occupies 4 spaces), one Submarine (3), and one Destroyer (2).  The board is made up of the panes within our lower deck slider: 5 rows (labeled A-E) by 6 columns (labeled 1-6).  </p>
		<h2>Playing</h2>
