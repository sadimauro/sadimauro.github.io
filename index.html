		<h1>Hey Nasrs!  Wanna play Battleship?</h1>
		<p>If so, read on.</p>
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>This will be one-player Battleship: you are the guessers and we control the ships.  So your objective is to sink all of our ships in the fewest moves possible.</p>
		<p>We've hidden three ships on our board: a Cruiser (occupies 3 spaces), one Submarine (3), and one Destroyer (2).</p>
