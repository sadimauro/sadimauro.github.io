## History
Carrollton Manor Improvement Association (CMIA) was organized and incorporated in 1941. 
Initially, meetings were held in member's houses or on their front porches and only a handful of residents paid dues. 
During the 60s and 70s, the number of year-round residents exceeded the number of vacation homes. During this period, 
the community operated a teen center in a basement structure that was attached to the Clubhouse. This structure was 
torn down in mid 80s after termites were found and no funds were available for repairs.
